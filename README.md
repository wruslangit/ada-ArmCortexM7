# ada-ArmCortexM7
Ada embedded programming on STM32 Nucleo-144 Development Board. This 144-pin board is based on the STM32 family of 32-bit RISC microcontrollers (MCU). The STM32 F7 series is based on the Arm Cortex-M7F core.  When the core contains an FPU (Floating-Point Unit), it is known as a Cortex-M7F, otherwise it is just just Cortex-M7.
